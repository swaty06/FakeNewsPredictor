# 📰 FakeNewsPredictor

This project is a **deep learning-based fake news classifier** that determines whether a given news headline or article is **Fake** or **Real**.

The model is built using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** layers in **TensorFlow/Keras** and deployed with a user-friendly interface using **Streamlit**.
